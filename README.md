IOT SYSTEM MANAGEMENT MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT
===========

This website is the outcome of my work during the `MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT` course, offering users the ability to monitor various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light through device statuses. Users can receive notifications when there are changes based on the system settings. Additionally, the website provides convenient control over equipment, allowing users to operate pumps and oxygen aerators according to their preferences.

## Features
